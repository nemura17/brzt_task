# BRZT TASK

DEMO: https://brzt-task.vercel.app/

In addition to the given tasks, I have also incorporated a couple of Angular best practices, including lazy loading, to enhance the application's performance and maintainability, as well as added some comments for better understanding of the logic, to enhance the application's performance and maintainability.

Furthermore, I have made another project, F1, a public repository, which I also mentioned in the interview, so feel free to check it out if you'd like! REPOSITORY: https://github.com/nemura17/f1

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
